                <h3>I Love It When A Plan Comes Together!</h3>
                <p>To have a good strategy is to have a plan of action.  
                    It helps in all areas of life to have a plan (get out of here dad...) 
                    and it’s no different in chess.  
                    Having a plan and sticking to it rubs off in your life away from the board, and having clear plans 
                    come to you like second nature will prove a huge advantage.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="why-chess-block">
                <h3>Win The Battles</h3>
                <p>Having a plan is one thing, but to have it survive first contact with the ‘enemy’ (or a real life setting) is quite another.  
                    In chess, tactics are an important component of your overall strategy.  To win the war you will have to win many smaller
                    battles along the way.  
                    The best way of doing that in chess, and in your daily life, is by using good tactics in line with your overall strategy. 
                </p>

            <div class="why-chess-block">
                <h3>Looks Like A Duck...</h3>
                <p>Making sure your strategy and tactics are viable at any given time means you have to constantly evaluate your current position on the board.
                    Real life example - our hunter-gathering ancestor’s ability to observe their given situation really helped them not die.  
                    Luckily the stakes in chess aren’t so high (depending on who your friends are…) but the practice comes in handy in your day-to-day life.

                <h3>Buy Low, Sell High</h3>
                <p>Give and take is a part of life, and good news, it's also a part of chess.  If you're a talented
                    haggler you might just be a closet chess player ripe to burst in on the Chess Space scene!  
                    Having observed the board and (hopefully) evaluted correctly, you will have a good idea which pieces are active, or have potential,  
                    and which do not.  Then your aim should be to trade your 'bad' pieces for your oponent's 'good'. Easy right?

                <h3>Is This Theory?</h3>
                <p>There are many ways to start a game of chess, depending on the first sequence of moves.  
                    The top players have been theorising for centuries, and the recent addition of computers has upped the stakes. 
                    However there is good news if you're not so hot on strategy and tactics, you can out memorise your opponent! 
                    If you’re a perfectionist then you might want to avoid chess or risk starving alone in your room, but for the rest of us a little bit of memorisation will help a lot.

                <h3>Riddles In The Dark … The Year 3434 Of The Second Age</h3>
                <p>Chess is one of the oldest games in the world, so needless to say there are plenty of old tomes to pour over (so settle down Gandalf).  
                    If you like to know every aspect of your history and then leverage it to your advantage against your ignorant friends (we all know somebody) 
                    … Chess is for you and Chess Space<sup>#trademarkIownitgetyourhandsoff</sup>  is the perfect place to get involved.
