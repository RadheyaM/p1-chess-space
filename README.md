# Chess Space

[View the Live Project](https://radheyam.github.io/p1-chess-space/index.html)

Chess Space is a site created by a hypothetical professional chess player with the aim of increasing his online following and signing users up to his lessons and/or chess club. The site provides clear and obvious ways for the user to sign-up as well as various resources designed to increase the user's interest in chess and motivation to sign-up.

## Features

  

-  _Navigation_

  

   - A consistent navigation bar across all three pages on the site with a logo to the right and links to Home, More Chess and Contact pages. The Nav bar is always displayed even when scrolling down the site which allows the user to change pages effortlessly.

   - the logo and nav options are cursor responsive

  
  

![Full Navigation Bar](media/navigation-bar.png)

  

   - On smaller screen widths the nav bar collapses into a hamburger style icon which expands upon interaction. This provides space saving and intuitive navigation to the user.

- The colour scheme developed naturally from the primary colours of the main images and in the case of text was based on good contrast with the background for the best readability possible.



### Code

- The Offer Cards - A video tutorial by [Web Zone](https://youtu.be/StnlVOm3ZZg) on Youtube was used to get the basic structure after which the code was improved upon to fit the website design.

- The Footer Code comes from the [Love Running Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode) from code institute, the CSS was edited/added to, to fit the design of Chess Space.

- The Contact form code is also based on the code in the [Love Running Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode) from Code Institute, but was edited to fit the Chess Space design, colour scheme etc.
