# Chess Space
Chess Space is a site created by a hypothetical professional chess player with the aim of increasing his online following and signing users up to his lessons and/or chess club.  The site provides clear and obvious ways for the user to sign-up as well as various resources designed to increase the user's interest in chess and motivation to sign-up.

## Features

- _Navigation_ 

  - A consistent navigation bar across all three pages on the site with a logo to the right and links to Home, More Chess and Contact pages.  The Nav bar is always displayed even when scrolling down the site which allows the user to change pages effortlessly.
  - the logo and nav options are cursor responsive


   ![Full Navigation Bar](media/navigation-bar.png)

  - On smaller screen widths the nav bar collapses into a hamburger style icon which expands upon interaction. This provides space saving and intuitive navigation to the user.

- _Offer Cards_

  - Three attractively designed offer cards with clear titles and descriptions with the sign-up options for the user.  The cards respond to a hovering cursor providing satisfying feedback to the user.
