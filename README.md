# Chess Space

[View the Live Project](https://radheyam.github.io/p1-chess-space/index.html)

Chess Space is a site created for a hypothetical professional chess player with the aim of increasing his online following and signing users up to his lessons and/or chess club. The site provides clear and obvious ways for the user to sign-up as well as various resources designed to increase user interest in chess and motivate subscription.

## User Experience

The primary purpose of the site is to facilitate subscription, and the homepage is designed to catch and hold user attention with the ultimate goal of inspiring subscrition.
   - to this end there is a signup button in the hero section for users coming to the site for that express purpose, no need to waste time searching and potentially loosing the user.
   - the decision was made during development to move the Why Chess section from middle to bottom to give the Offer Cards a more prominent position, and in terms of overall page flow, giving a nice break between the large and colourful Hero and Why Chess sections.  If the user is not quite ready, they should still have the options in mind while engaged with the Why Chess section.
   - Orange is used for the 'call to action' button/cards as it stands out nicely and contrasts well with the two images and the header and footer 'aqua' colour scheme.
   - The More Chess page is for users new to chess and looking for further avenues into the online community.  The page offers value to the user and also to the overall goal of the site in that the user will remember where they started, and should return if they desire lessons or to get involved in a club community etc.

## Features

  

-  _Navigation_

  

   - A consistent navigation bar across all three pages on the site with a logo to the right and links to Home, More Chess and Contact pages. The Nav bar is always displayed even when scrolling down the site which allows the user to change pages effortlessly.

   - the logo and nav options are cursor responsive

   - On smaller screen widths the nav bar collapses into a hamburger style icon which expands upon interaction. This provides space saving and intuitive navigation to the user.

## Deployment


## Credits
### Code

- The Offer Cards - A video tutorial by [Web Zone](https://youtu.be/StnlVOm3ZZg) on Youtube was used to get the basic structure after which the code was improved upon to fit the website design.

- The Footer Code comes from the [Love Running Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode) from code institute, the CSS was edited/added to, to fit the design of Chess Space.

- The Contact form code is also based on the code in the [Love Running Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode) from Code Institute, but was edited to fit the Chess Space design, colour scheme etc.

### Content


- The More Chess page contains quotes taken from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/300--chess-quotes).

- The More Chess page contains an interactive board game iframe from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home) and two Youtube videos from [GingerGM](https://www.youtube.com/c/GingerGM) and [Chess Press](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5tjdWdIJYqA5Yg7omrgZQ)..

- The remaining written content is original work by the developer.
